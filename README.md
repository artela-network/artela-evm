## Artela-EVM

This is an enhanced version of Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM), it provides the ability to:

- Track the state changes
- Track the call stacks

With the above 2 abilities, it will be easier for Artela Aspect developers to know the states of their dApps, which could reduce the security issues in some ways.
